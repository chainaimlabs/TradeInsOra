# TradeInsOra

TradeInsOra is a zk platform for defining and assembling composable proofs layered for the export-import trade orchestration, providing MSMEs with reduced counter-party risk and wider business and financial access.
 
Context:
The team at ChainAim Labs has been working with many trade entities( UAE Ministry of trade, WTO, Department of Commerce India, General Authority of Foreign Trade, Saudi ), governments ( Saudi, India, US, UK) and MSMEs globally, and has been studying the maturity of blockchain adoption on the consumers/ MSME side as well as Enterprises. Many of these organizations have realized the need and are promoting inclusivity themes for MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises)
MSMEs are important globally (Davies, Narayanan and Balasubramanian 2021): 
   90% of all businesses globally are MSMEs; they employ over 50% of all workers
   They are even more important in developing countries like India, particularly in the context of   exports/imports (Chakravarthy, Bharathi, Khire, and Narayanan, 2023): 
   30% of GDP (40% of emerging economies income globally).
EXIM Bank in India, while working on Factoring solutions, found that the export cash cycle was 60-120 days post shipment in India, in the best case, and much more on transactional discrepancies.
The MSME Finance gap ranges from 10% of GDP in South Africa to 27% of GDP in Brazil, as informal SMEs account for 34-58% of formal SMEs in these countries (Narayanasamy, Narayanan and Shivakumar, 2023). 
Most insurance flows spend one-third of the cost on admin instead of paying out claims. Our research (Dicaprio, Narayanan, McDaniel, and Norberg, 2020) finds that using blockchain to solve this trade finance issue could save at least 2-3 trillion USD globally, with most gains coming from exports promoted in developing countries. However, this financing needs high-quality instrumentation to be funded, keeping capital away from trade finance. 
Please refer to additional details in our recent research, which is documented in our GitHub link.

In our extensive research on blockchain adoption documented in the Blockchain Adoption Framework, we receive feedback that the technical, functional, and scalability are maturing. However, real-world applications are still hesitant because of regulatory and privacy reasons. 
The blockchain adoption framework published calls.out the Friction maps, and highlights privacy centric blockchain capabilities as the pivotal next step to drive blockchain utility.

In our extensive research on blockchain adoption documented in the Blockchain Adoption Framework, we receive feedback that the technical, functional, and scalability are maturing. However, real-world applications are still hesitant because of regulatory and privacy reasons. 

MSMEs, predominantly proprietary owners/workers (in the fine line of GST borderline), are increasingly embracing blockchain technology in Export-Import (EXIM) Trade and Insurance are looking for. 
a. end2end blockchain solutions beyond payments - compliant with rules not just around money transfer but also end-to-end compliance of their EXIM workflow
b. * privacy-oriented exchange of information with counterparties (Importers, Financiers, Regulators). Privacy includes regulatory privacy and business sensitivity.
   Exhibiting credentials like Geographical Nativity badges in the context of imminent export CBAM     regulations without revealing any sensitive information
c. * Days Outstanding creep enormously because of transactional trade discrepancies. Roughly half of the transactions are indicated to have some kind of discrepancies, that only show up way late.
d. * need predictability, transparency, and shortened Days Outstanding cycles including access to non-traditional sources like defi
e. * a way for insurance to work, which is completely broken and helpless even admitted by the Insurance providers - the primary reason being opaqueness.

# Proposed Solution 

The key behind the proposed solution is identifying, defining, and templating the counter-party risk for the selected checkpoints the counter-party cares about. All the rest of the flow can happen in all enterprise systems, but verifiable proof at critical interim milestones reduces the risk and lets the financier make decisions on payouts. The reconciliation is step-wise accounted for and can be proven on the MINA blockchain for the most meaningful interim milestones, where the rest can be on other blockchains, and enterprise systems.

In the Open Account Trade model, where other financiers are NOT involved, this could lead to a Seller-Buyer negotiated model, executed step-by-step, addressing discrepancies every step of the way for those meaningful, without having to deal with exposing more than needed information ( business sensitive ), or discrepancies after the fact which typically affects cash flow.
